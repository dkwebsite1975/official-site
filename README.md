# The Original Democratic Kampuchea Discord's Archive Website
---
### Who are we?
The Democratic Kampuchea Discord server started out as a roleplay server in 2019. Founded by the user *☭Comrade Angkar☭#7629*, it was one of the earliest servers publicly available on Discord devoted to Democratic Kampuchea, although it maintained a much smaller membership and community. Two years later, in 2021, Angkar would log off of Discord for the last time, never making a return under that name or identity. Because of his role as the lead administrator, the server was doomed to failure, leading to a splintering of its membership. Our "Democratic Kampuchea" server is one of the earliest iterations of these splinter communities, and is the only one to have maintained a continuity directly from Angkar. BlackMetalMarxist, among the other members of the administration team, have worked to restore the "DK" server, although it has taken upon a new, more educational identity in recent years. Working to forward a critical view of Western narratives concerning Southeast Asia, our server seeks to educate both its members and the general public via provision of resources and documentation that stimulates a constructive dialogue about one of the most radical and shocking periods in global history. 

### Why the website?
Over the years, imitators have appeared on Discord with the sole intention of garnering members for whatever reason. These servers attempt to use our library as some kind of "exclusive" possession that is "unique" to their server, requiring potential researchers to join the server and accept their potential restrictions. For this reason, we have decided to make our entire archive free of use and free of charge--even without JavaScript! We ask that those who use the archive be responsible with these resoures and this archive in general.

### Freedom of use
We request that anyone who uses the resources maintained on this archive **not** charge for their distribution or reproduction. We request as well that nobody restrict their access, either through paywalls or other restrictions that require the user to submit information or otherwise. The code that this website is composed of is under the Gnu Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0) and was written by Discord user Epikeia on the Democratic Kampuchea Discord server.
