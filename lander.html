            <h3>Our Purpose in Brief</h3>
            <p>If you have been with us on Discord over the years, you're likely familiar with this archive. The difference here is that it has been completely externally hosted from Discord, as well as from the proprietary hosts that would otherwise monitor the accessing of the source. The purpose of this webpage is to provide a completely tracker-free and bullshit-free edition of this collection. Many other servers have copied this layout in an attempt to garner members by generating a false exclusivity around these sources; we have decided to combat this in a manner we feel is well within the spirit of DK -- freeing it to anyone with an internet connection.</p>

            <h3>Navigating the Archive</h3>
            <p>If you wish to navigate the archive, you can easily do so by clicking on its label on the navigation bar above, and then looking for your needed disambiguation. The largest section is "General Resources", which comprises nearly 100 resources as of 2025. We do not have a search bar as we do not believe in the use of JavaScript, as it gums up the experience for many privacy-oriented users.</p>

            <h3>Have Something Cool?</h3>
            <p>If you would like to send us a resource, volunteer to assist, or contact us for any other reason, we are reachable via the above Discord link, or are otherwise available for contact via the form on the "Contact" page linked in the navigation bar above. Please contact us only sparingly using this form; Discord is a preferred method of long-term contact. Although, different methods may be arranged, depending on the circumstance.</p>
