            <h3>Who are We?</h3>
            <p>The Democratic Kampuchea Discord server started out as a roleplay server in 2019. Founded by the user ☭Comrade Angkar☭#7629, it was one of the earliest servers publicly available on Discord devoted to Democratic Kampuchea, although it maintained a much smaller membership and community at the time. Two years later, in 2021, Angkar would log off Discord for the last time, never making a return under that name or identity. Because of his role as the lead administrator, the server was doomed to failure, leading to a fracturing of its core leadership. Our "Democratic Kampuchea" server is one of the earliest iterations of the splinter communities, and is the only one to have maintained a line of continuity directly from Angkar. BlackMetalMarxist, among the other members of the administration team, have worked to restore the "DK" server; although, it has taken upon a new, more educational identity in recent years. Working to forward a critical view of Western narratives concerning Southeast Asia, our server seeks to educate both its members and the general public via the provisioning of resources and documentation that stimulates a constructive dialogue about one of the most controversial and shocking periods in global history.</p>
